### Hi there, I'm Sercan. ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m an enthusiastic and motivated backend developer. I prefer C# as my primary programming language also welcome other programming languages as well. I pay attention to object oriented programming and solid principles while developing software. My career goal is to become a senior-level backend developer.
